Prolog Server Agent for LogiMooII (PSAs)

To try this out with BinProlog (included in bin/bp.exe), type

brun.bat

If you have a Jinni 8.4x or later intallation, type

jrun.bat

Each of the commands starts Web services on port 8888.

These scripts use BinProlog 11.x and Jinni s embedded Web servers
which now allow direct deployment of Web services written in Prolog.

To run the LogiMOO chat agent from a Web page type

http://localhost:8888/logimooAgent/frame.html

You can adapt them easily to demo any Prolog application from the Web or
as a self-contained laptop demo requiring not other Web server installation.
