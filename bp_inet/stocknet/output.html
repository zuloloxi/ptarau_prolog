    <h3>Historical Stock Market Prolog Database Generator. How it works?</h3>
    <PRE>
Just fill in a stock ticker and click on the link to download and
save the resulting Prolog database file. A Jinni Server Agent will
find on the net the historical data for the stock, figure out the 
day of the week for each entry and convert it to a Prolog file.
That can take a few seconds, unless someone has already created the
file. Data is adjusted for stock splits and goes back to 1990. For
instance, assuming you chose ticker <STRONG>ibm,</STRONG> clauses look like this:

<STRONG>ibm(Date,DayOfWeek,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,AdjustedClose).</STRONG>

You can also download this 4MB <A href="http://logic.csci.unt.edu/tarau/data/stocknet_data/markets/all_stocks.pl" target="_blank">Prolog database</A> about stocks
listed on the Nasdaq, Nyse and Amex markets, with clauses of the form:

<STRONG>stock(Ticker,Market,Number,CompName,MarketCapInThousandDollars,Description).</STRONG>
