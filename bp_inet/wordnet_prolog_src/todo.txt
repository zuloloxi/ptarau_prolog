Turing World

This is about talking to a "CPU-agent" to set memory and move control
using a limited vocabulary natural language. It is a kind of kids
assembler. The main purpose is simply to provide a minimal
Turing-equivalent natural language subset. Most of the objects
can be implemented using a Finite Function package.

Conversational Agents as State Machines

A conversational agent is an approximation of a blind, paralized from the neck person who also happens to be deprived of a few other sensorial functions, while being held in solitary confinment.
