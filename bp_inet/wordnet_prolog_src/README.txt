jrun.bat

starts a Java based server hat also works in command line mode
after typing

?-chat.

The Java server supports a prototype applet window, try it
by pointing your browser to

http://localhost:6002/chat.html

than type any Prolog command in it. (TODO: replace the ?-
prompt with the conversational agent's chat prompt.

Both agent can serve HTTP based Web interfaces, see README in directory
../wordnet_agent.

Enjoy,
