Prolog Server Agents (PSAs)

To try this out with BinProlog (included in bin/bp.exe), type

bgo.bat

If you have a Jinni 2003 8.4x or later intallation, type

jgo.bat

Each of the commands starts Web services on port 8080.

These scripts use BinProlog 9.7x and Jinni 2003's embedded Web servers
which now allow direct deployment of Web services written in Prolog.

To run this prototye from a Web page type

http://localhost:8080/index.html

You can adapt them easily to demo any Prolog application from the Web or
as a self-contained laptop demo requiring not other Web server installation.
