    <h3>Instant Web Services with the Jinni Virtual Server Registry. How it works?</h3>
    <pre>Download the Java or .NET based <STRONG>Jinni 2003 </STRONG>evaluation copy from 
<A href="http://www.binnetcorp.com/Jinni">http://www.binnetcorp.com/Jinni</A> and start it on your computer (which
can sit happily behind a firewall, NAT etc.) with:

    <b>jinni.bat jinni_tunnel</b> 

This will start the Jinni HTTP server in your local directory and open
a <STRONG>tunnel</STRONG> from it to a <STRONG>Web address</STRONG> dynamically allocated to you. The tunnel 
will allow other people to run Jinni applets or see Web pages located on<STRONG>  
your computer,</STRONG> even if it is <EM>behind a firewall or NAT</EM>!<BR> 
The Web address looks like this: 

<b>http://logic.csci.unt.edu:40001/...your-html-file...(defaults to index.html)</b>

To reserve a tunnel for <EM><STRONG>another server</STRONG></EM> on your local machine (let's say an 
Apache Web server that you have on your localhost port 80), choose a 4 digit 
<STRONG>tunnel number </STRONG>and a <STRONG>password</STRONG>, then click <b>submit</b>. The agent will remember 
you and assign you a lease for a <STRONG>Jinni Virtual Server Tunnel Number</STRONG>, which you 
can renew as many times as you wish by using the same password. <b>Please write 
down the returned TUNNEL NUMBER!</b> It is <STRONG>YOURS</STRONG> only, uniquely associated with
your password. Then, start Jinni with: 

<b>jinni.bat tunnel_to(TunnelNumber,LocalServerPort)</b> 

It will map your <STRONG>local server</STRONG> to a Jinni Web Service. Assuming that you have a
Web Server on your laptop or home PC, on default HTTP port 80 and we have assigned
you port 1234, your virtual server will look like a Web site up and running at: 

<STRONG>   http://logic.csci.unt.edu:1234</STRONG> </pre>
    <PRE>If you do not have a Web server on your machine, you can start the Jinni Web server  
on a given port and a given root directory by typing: </PRE>
    <PRE>   <STRONG>jinni.bat run_http_server(Port,Root)</STRONG></PRE>
    <PRE>Besides using this form, you can also reserve a permanent tunnel number directly, with</PRE>
    <PRE></pre>
    <PRE></PRE><PRE><B>jinni.bat reserve_tunnel(TunnelNumber,Password,Description)</B></PRE> <PRE>Enjoy,
