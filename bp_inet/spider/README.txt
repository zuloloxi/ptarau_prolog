Take a look at http_spider.pl and http_spider_scrips.pl
for the specification of the spider predictes.

Then, in directory ../tests

Type

  bp -h25000 -t2000 -s2000 http_test

The command line parameters ensure large enough data areas which might be needed 
for some of the tests. Assuming you are connected to the Internet, try out:

?-t1.
....
?-t44.

Enjoy,
